## Biography

Lucian Edge is the SVP of Heavy Metal at Spotify-RCA. As a kid, he was told
he didn't have the talent to be in the music industry, and started working
for Spotify-RCA in the mailroom as a way out of the combat zone. He was
told early in a chance meeting with Jimmy Iovine (later the head of Spotify-RCA)
that he would never make it. This, combined with a lifetime of abuse in the
CZ, has motivated Lucian to climb to the top.

He will stop at nothing, and is currently stealing from Arasaka, stealing a
dead cryogenic head, and now funding a re-extraction and sanction mission.
