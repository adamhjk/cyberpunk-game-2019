# Mission Brief

We've been contacted by Bobby Two-Tone, the fixer, for a job that will be of
particular interest to you. Turns out our old friend Martin Sandoval is back 
in the game, and the surprise of nobody, he's run a double cross again. This time
he double crossed Bobby.

Bobby hired Martin's team (including our old "friend" Percival) to extract some
genetic material from a facility in New Mexico. Martin's team was successful - 
but then skipped the drop with Bobby, instead sending him a package 
with a fox mask and the following message:

```
Change of plan. If you want the package, you'll have to pay more for it 
than my other bidders. October 12th, safe room at Club Atlantis. Wear
the mask. Come alone.
```

Bobby wants the package retrieved, and he would prefer not to pay for it twice.

## Compenstation

### Base Pay

Each team member will recieve 5000Eb.

### Secrecy Bonus

In exchange for not revealing the contents of the package, each member will
receive an additional 5000Eb. If the contents are revealed, this bonus will
not be paid.

## Target Package

The target package is a [Taylor Wharton Cyrogenic Cylinder](http://twcryo.com/product/liquid-cylinders/). It's on castors. It cannot be opened.

### Leads

* The meet is in the secure room at Club Atlantis, in two days.
* Bobby did some digging, and discovered that Sandoval has a compound filled
with his family in the Combat Zone.
