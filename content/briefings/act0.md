# Mission Brief

The Johnson requires retrieval of stolen intellectual property, that they
believe is being developed in violation of their patent and trademark agreement by a
research scientist at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST).

The mission is to infiltrate the OIST campus, and retrieve the intellectual property. No
trace of the intellectual property is to remain on site.

## Compensation

### Base Pay

Each team member will receive 5000Eb, and commensurate senority bonus.

### Time Bonus

A 4000Eb bonus will be paid, per team member, if the retrieval takes place in the next 48 hours.

## Target Intellectual Property

The target intellectual property is a piece of highly advanced software, likely being
stored directly on a mainframe datacore. The software can be identified by looking for
links to its required data-lake. The checksum for the data-lake is:

```
c513b91d631b1258a4eda15a54a360fb5753a6e7c2d1d5a91e2283d630ca5b287eb6d331fee1cd8dcc67254a0bf3cc096b62faaa1feca2eb92d2101d06575de6
```

The data-lake, and all services utilizing it, must be recovered and removed from the OIST
systems.

#### OIST Laboratories

OIST has a wide range of laboratories; supercomputing, wet biology labs, etc. You can find the full
breakdown here, at [OIST Laboratories Breakdown](https://www.oist.jp/research-facilities#lab1).

##### OIST Sea House

The Sea House is the location of the mainframe and datacore; it is part hotel and part research facility,
focused on children and families. The brown section on Level 2 is the secure facility that houses the
mainframe and datacore. To our knowledge, the facility is not connected directly to the Net.

outfit whose headquarters is in Naha. Threat level is predicted to be low.

## Transportation
