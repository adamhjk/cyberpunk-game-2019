# Objective

The players are hired by Bobby Two Tone to re-acquire a stolen container of
genetic material. West Coast Recovery is being hired because the thief is none
other than Martin Sandoval and his crew, including Percival.

# Theme

Double cross

## Scenes

### Opening

Virtual briefing room at West Coast Recover, logged in to the net.

Wilson McGee is briefing the team on the contract. Bobby Two-Tone is present personally,
and fronts as the customer.

Goal is to get the players on the trail of Martin, and introduce the idea that
they are getting genetic material.

#### Things to Lean

- Bobby Two-Tone hired Sandoval and Percival to assemble a team and recover the genetic material for him
- Bobby wants to know who the other buyers are, and he wants the material returned.
- The material is classified; they are being paid an extra 10k EB each for the extra risk
- Bobby is a fixer and music producer, known around Night City
- Claims to know about the team's realtionship with Sandoval and Percival because it was big news
- Sandoval and Percival have been active as a team over the last few years
- Sandoval has scheduled an auction between three interested parties, and hopes
  to spark a bidding war. It is in two days, at the high security room at Club Atlantis. This
  includes Bobby as one of the buyers.
- It will be a blind auction - one representative from each buyer, plus Sandoval. All buyers
  must be present to win. Bobby has been instructed to wear a Fox mask.
- Atlantis Security has to know who the buyers are, because they're checking people in.
- Bobby says Sandoval has been slowly moving his family from Nicaragua to
  a compound in the Night City combat zone.
- Bobby doesn't care what happens to Sandoval and Percival, but his preference
  is that they are flatlined.
- Bobby has a couple of bands he is working with, in particular a band named Pounder,
  who is huge in the undergound scene - the vanguard of the New Wave of American Metal.
  (HARD)
- Bobby is really working for someone else - he's working for Lucian Edge, SVP 
  of Metal for Spotify-RCA (SUPER HARD)
- Sandoval has moved his entire extended family to the combat zone.
- They are almost 100 of them, and they are in a converted factory.
- Felicia Sandoval is the only known contact from Bobby; she's Martin's no-good sister,
  and she has a bad drinking and drug problem. She likes underground combat sports.
- They are planning a Qunicanera for Estefania, tomorrow. (They can learn this from Felicia)

### Atlantis

Club Atlantis is at the top 3 floors of the tower attached to Piper Memorial
Sports Arena, in the heart of China Town.

The club itself is built like Escher's house of stairs:

* First floor is the club entry - scanners for weapons and illegal cyberware. Armor is 
  not allowed, including armored clothing. 
* Escher style stairs lead up to the second floor - big open gaps, white square blocks
  made of marble.
* Second floor is a bar and a dance floor. Booths line the walls, each of which are 
  reached by escher style stairs, clibming up the walls. 
* Third floor are the private rooms. Here sound-proof rooms are attached to the walls,
  with the main secure room suspended in the middle of the floor with escher-style 
  stairs, sound dampeners, and security on the walls.

The club heats up at 10pm, and runs till 5am. 

Piper memorial is named after Rowdy Roddy Piper, the professional wrestler who gave
his life thwarting a high-jacking and attempted assassintation of the president of the
united states. The first floor of the club is connected directly to Piper Memorial stadium.

A UFC match is happening at the stadium.

#### NPCs

* Atlantis is owned by Lester Chang. Lester is like the mayor of Chinatown. 
* Shui Xue is the 63 year old mistress of Lester, and she runs the club day to day with an iron fist.
* Zhou Yahui is 40, and the head of security for the club.
* Hui Ping is a 20 year old hostess at the club, who loves anime and teddy bears. Has a smash
  habit she's hiding from work.
* An Xiang is the book-keeper for the club. She has worked for Lester and Shui for 20 years,
  and has never gotten a raise. She's happy to stick it to the man.
* The Philharmonic Vampires are the gang nearby

### Sandoval Compound

Sandoval has renovated an abandoned textile factory, turning it into an apartment block
and compond for his extended family. He's been slowly importing them for years.

The factory is 5 stories tall, and almost 100 people are living there now.

The Quincaneria is tomorrow, the day before the meet. If the players deside to disrupt
it, they will meet the Neon Nights there too - as they will raid the Quincaneria in an
attempt to get at Sandoval.

#### NPCS

* Elena Sandoval, Martin's mother. She's 82, and she's like Howard Stern's mom. She thinks
  Martin is the good son.
* Estefania Noa is the 14, almost 15 year old first cousin of Martin. She's about to have
  her Quincanera tomorrow!
* Ezequiel Alvaro is Martin's half-brother. Runs the compound.
* Felicia Sandoval is Martin's sister. She's 40, and despises Martin and Elena. Mother of
  Estefania. Not a good mother - she has a bad history of drugs and partying. Hangs out
  around a lot of bad people, even after moving to the compound in the zone.
