performance... or whatever they decide

## Act 0

### Gathering

Sandoval hires the team for support on an extraction of a piece of highly
valuable software (Soulkiller) from a Japanese Araksaka mainframe hidden in a
secure facility. Sandoval escapes with the data, stiffs the players, and is in
the wind.

That was 3 years ago. Since then, the players Corp contact on the job has
started West Coast Recovery, a bail-bonds, loan sharking, and pawn business.
It operates as a front for the team, which takes high paying edge-runs under
the table.

## Act I

### Intro Goal

Get the players hired by Bobby Two Tone to re-acquire the package, and get
revenge on Sandoval.

### Intro Enemy

Martin Sandoval

### Intro Situation

Bobby two-tone reaches out to West Coast Recovery, with a job for the team. 
He's got a line on Sandoval, who has stolen a payload he was supposed to
deliver. He wants the payload retrieved, and doesn't care what happens to
Sandoval. The package must be retrieved in 60 days. He has 2 leads:

* A lead on Sandoval's family, living in the combat zone in night city
* A lead on an auction being run for the merch 

## Act II

### Set-Up Journey

Family lead reveals his reasoning - he's got a massive family, in debt to
a nicaraguan drug kingpin. He's been slowly buying them passage to night
city. This leads them to the hideout in the combat zone.

The auction lead puts them on the trail of Stringer, and reveals that the
program stolen in game zero is involved as well. We learn that lucian edge
was the contract in the original deal. The knowledge that the payload is
the head of RJD is learned here.

Sandoval himself is hiding out in the combat zone. This lead brings the
players to a confrontation with the Neon Nights, who are also tracking
the payload, along with Sandovals trail.

Eventually, they discover that the transfer is going to happen at the
docklands.

### First Attempt

Sandoval, the players, Stringer's men, and the Neon Nights all converge
to try and get the payload. Sandoval is killed in the crossfire. 

## Act III

The players must retrieve the payload, and decide which faction gets it,
or what to do with RJDs head.
