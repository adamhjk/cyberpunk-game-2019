# Objective

Introduce the players to cyberpunk, and to Sandoval as a bad guy

## Theme

Double cross

## Scenes

### Opening

Virtual briefing room at West Coast Recovery, logged in to the net.

Wilson McGee is briefing the team on the contract.

Goal of this scene is to get the players planning.

#### Things to learn

- There are 10 families staying at Sea house; they are all there for
  "experimental therapy for ADD"
- There are 20 campus guards
- There is a small 4 man Arasaka Security contingent (harder!)
- The lab is accessable by security clearance, needs biometric fingerprint and a badge
- 4 People have the clearance; Jane Nakamura, Kendo Eido, Lawerence Phil, Alice Bergstrom
- Jane is an alcoholic; Lawerence is cheating on his wife; Kendo works late and likes to eat chips; Alice works 9-5 and takes care of her kids
- Johnson paid extra for anonymity
- Paid extra for payload anonymity, too
- Johnson is from Infocomp (harder!)
- Johnson is Jeffrey Stringer, VP of Marketing (super hard!)
- The IP is using a lot of data at low latency and high processing power; to need a datacore and lake
- It's probably some kind of experimental AI (harder!)
- OIST has a go to market research relationship with arasaka
- The kids brains are being scanned every week
- The brain scans are in the data-lake
- Malfunctioning AIs are the programs, based ont eh brains of the kids
- They haven't successfully gotten the kids into the soulkiller, because you h ave to destroy the meat brain

### Infiltration

Just role play it!

#### Things that must happen

- Eventually, they need to get to the data-core, and defend it.
- The alarm will trigger

### Extraction

The players are in the middle of an extraction from a secure data vault
inside the okinawa institute of science. Sandoval is in charge, and Percival
is extracting the data. They have to survive for 5 rounds while Percival
extracts the information, then get to the evac location. There are two
AVs ready for the pickup, and at the last moment, Sandoval and Percival
wind up in the lead AV, with the rest of the team in the second. Once
over the ocean, the AV fires on the players, and the game ends with it
hitting the pacific ocean.

This is where the Arasaka Solos and the Cops come in.

## Coolness Factor

The basics are all introduced, and it sets up Percival and Sandoval as
motherfuckers. The location is dope.
