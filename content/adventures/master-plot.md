# Master Plot 

## Sentence

Lucian Edge, CEO of Spotify-RCA, wants the head of Ronnie James Dio by June 31, so
that they can ressurect him and force him to write and an album by the Grammy
deadline, and is having difficulty getting it using a small extraction team
lead by Martin Sandoval because he has decided to sell it himself.

## Who?

Lucian Edge, the SVP of Metal at Spotify-RCA. Lucian rules the digital music
distribution syndicate, on the strength of a resurgence in New Californian
Heavy Metal. 

Bobby Two-Tone, a fixer and part time music producer. Came up with Lucian 
as kids in the combat zone. The cut out used by the players.

Ronnie James Dio, former lead singer for Elf, Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Heaven
& Hell, and his own band, Dio. A legendary heavy metal singer and lyricist,
responsible for inspiring a whole generation of metal musicions. It is believed
that Dio died of stomach cancer in 2006 - but he had his head put in cryogenic
storage, beliving that Cybertechnology would eventually allow him to ressurect
himself.

Wendy Gaxiola (Dio), wife of Ronnie. After the collapse, she founded the
nomad gang known as the Neon Knights. The Knights travel the wasteland, fighting
for the forgotten and forlorn. She has decided to steal the head from Sandoval.

Martin Sandoval, a mercenary Solo. Sandoval was originally hired to transport
the frozen head from a cryo facitiliy in Houston, Texas. He had his netrunner
hack the cryo facility first, and learned what he was transporting, and why. He
decided to sell it on the dark net to the highest bidder.

Jeffrey Stringer, VP of Arasaka-Sony-BMG Records. The highest bidder on the
payload. Sandoval also sold him the information that Edge has a copy of Soulkiller,
and the plan to use it to force Dio to create records. Thinks that's a brilliant
idea, and wants the head for himself. He's paying Sandoval a bonus for the location
of the mainframe storing the priated copy of Soulkiller.

## What? 

Edge wants to use stolen Arasaka Soulkiller technology to turn Dio into a slave
brain, so he can use him to churn out NCHM hits. 

Wendy wants to bring back Ronnie, who would never have wanted to be a slave to
the label, and to resurrect him into a clone body. What she isn't telling anyone
is that her long term plan is to put Ronnie under her control, and force him to
tour - putting the money to work to fund the Knights.

Stringer wants Ronnie for similar reasons to Edge, but also to learn the location
of Lucian Edge's copy of Soulkiller.

## Where?

Night City, the Spotify-RCA building in the Corporate Plaza, the Combat Zone

## When?

Right away - they only have a few months before the grammy submission window closes
for the year.

## Why?

Lucian Edge gets a huge 50mil eb bonus package if he wins a hat trick of
grammies - Album, Record, and Song of the year. He knows if he can get Ronnie
into the system soon enough, he can turn out hits that aren't just inspiried by
Dio - they'll be Dio, and he'll have the Grammy on lock. It's the last category
he needs.

If he wins, in addition to the bonus, he'll get his true desire: he'll be next in
line to be CEO of Spotify-RCA. He believes he can then switch sides, and take over
Arasaka-Sony-BMG Records, the largest label on the planet. Everyone will know he's
the man then.

## How?

First he hires Sandoval, who double crosses him. Know that he knows he's been double
crossed, he has Bobby Two-Tone hire the players due to their background and
distaste for Sandoval.

If he can get the head, he'll use Soulkiller to trap its brain patterns in the 'Net,
and crank out hits for the man.

# Theme

Power corrupts

## Expect?

We expect that everyone in power has a dirty motive, and that they will do whatever
they can to get it.

## Established?

It makes us feel like heros, because we invetiably become the ones that fight against
the corruption.

## Different?

The players start off working for Sandoval, and then have to choose what to do with
Ronnie.
